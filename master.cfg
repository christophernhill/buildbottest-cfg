#
# Buildbot control starts from master.cfg 
#
# Some key things it defines are the master setup, the worker setup,
# the builders, factory configurations and a schedule for running tests.
#
# The master setup is the overall controlling program that 
#  1. launches builders on workers according to some schedule
#     or event
#   - and -
#  2. gathers builder results and provides a web tool for viewing
#
#  A "builder" in buildbot is a handle to some pieces of code that can be run and checked
#  for success. It can support any manner of test as needed. Each builder launches
#  one "type" of test.
#
#  A worker in buildbot is a separate computer resource instance that runs "builder"
#  tests in response to requests from the master. The workers can be manually started
#  or there is a way to create "latent" workers that start on demand.
#
#  A factory in buildbot specifies the squence of programs/script steps that
#  a certain test will execute.
